# Smart-homes-and-weather_Evaluating-energy-use-efficiency-
Smart building technology allow buildings to be more efficient, comfortable and easier to manage by connecting IOT devices, collaborate, analyze and use real time intelligence with IOT applications and solutions as part of a Smart Building platform. A challenge for the implementation of such technologies is the evaluation of the energy use efficiency under variable climatic conditions during a year.  GOALS Evaluate and predict energy efficiency performance from solar energy during a year and variable weather conditions. Tools to be used: Python Pandas, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib Evaluate in what state of the USA solar energy is more or less efficient   Tools to be used: Plotly or leaflet or D3 or Tableau (To be determined...)
